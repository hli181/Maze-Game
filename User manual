For ArrayList and LinkedList, what I do is the implementation of the list interface. I finish the Arraylist and Linkedlist implementation then for those lists we 
can call these method for other program when the object is arraylist or linkedlist. 

In my LinkedList class, I set head is unchangable, the first index of linkedlist is the node that head point to. It follows this form: Head -> Element -> Element.
When call clear() method, head is still exist but the size of linkedlist is 0. Because we need the elements behind the removed index move forward to fill this 
arraylist, thus, I write Removegap() method to remove this gap after remove the element of given index.

For add() method, the default capacity of this arraylist is 2, when the arraylist is full, if we still wang to add element on arraylist, i write growing() method
to make new space for the arraylist to store the element. One thing need pay attention is for add(index,element) method, we would like to add a new element in a 
specific index of arraylist, so I write makeroom() method to let those elements behind the index move backward one index and make the element of this specific
index is what we want to add, the previous one element of this index move to next index.
